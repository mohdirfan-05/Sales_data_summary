# 📊 Task 7: Sales Summary using SQLite & Python

Welcome! 👋  
This repository is part of my **Data Analyst Internship **, where I demonstrate how to extract and visualize sales data using **SQL inside Python**. The goal? Get hands-on with databases, write SQL queries, and build basic visual insights with Python!

## 📁 Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sales_summary.ipynb` | ✅ Google colab Notebook with the Python script that connects to the database, runs SQL queries, prints a sales summary, and creates a bar chart. |
| `mydatabase.db` | 🗃️ SQLite database file containing the sales data (Laptop, Mouse, etc.) |
| `sales_chart.png` | 📈Bar chart showing revenue per product |

## 🚀 What I Did

### 🔧 Built a Sales Database
 1. Created a SQLite database mydatabase.db with a sales table and inserted data for products like Laptop 💻, Mouse 🖱️,Keyboard ⌨️ etc.
 2. Wrote a Python script in a Jupyter Notebook to connect to the database and run an SQL query to calculate total quantity and revenue per product.
 3. Used pandas to load the query results and printed the summary.
 4. Created a bar chart using matplotlib to visualize revenue per product and saved it as sales_chart.png.
